# ✅ Data Redundancy Removal System

## 📌 Objective
To develop a system that ensures database efficiency by identifying and preventing the insertion of redundant or false-positive data.

## 🚀 Features
- **Redundancy Detection**: Automatically identifies and classifies data as redundant or false positive.
- **Validation Mechanism**: Verifies new data entries against existing records.
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents duplicate entries in the cloud database.
- **Verified Data Appending**: Only unique, validated data is added.
- **Database Accuracy**: Ensures high accuracy and efficiency by avoiding redundancy.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- SQLite3 (or any preferred database)
